Introduction to Using KnockoutJS with Visualforce
=================================================

This demonstrates some basic usage of KnockoutJS and Visualforce, creating a simple page that lists contacts for account and allows them to be edited easily. Right now this is just the final result, this will be broken down into steps with more comments shortly.

The page does use some Apex remoting to load and save data (without any error protection) so should be easy to understand even for those with little or no experience with Apex.


The CSS is hosted publically via dropbox so should work for everyone as is, KnockoutJS is included via CDN so there is not need to create static resources to try this code.

More to come soon!
