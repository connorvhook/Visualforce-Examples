Visualforce-Examples
====================

Examples of various Visualforce techniques for Salesforce.com Developers.

#Related-List
This is a demonstration of creating a small Visualforce page which can be embedded in a page layout to show a filtered list of related records. In this example displays a related list of opportunities on a contact page, where the contact is set as the primary contact via an Opportunity Contact Role record.

This is not packaged code (yet) but will hopefully demonstrate various techniques in a step by step manner through commented code.
